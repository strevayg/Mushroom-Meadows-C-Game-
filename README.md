# Mushroom-Meadows-C-Sharp-Game-
Developed a half-semester long game containing a 2-D platformer and a variation on “whack-a-mole”. 
Learned how to code in C# and use the Unity platform to single-handily create the mushroom version of “whack-a-mole”, the 3-D rendered houses in the main scene, and the sprites/images for both mini-games. My team and I collaborated and modularized the project.
