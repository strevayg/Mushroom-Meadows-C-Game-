# Mushroom-Meadows-C-Sharp-Game-
For convience, the entire project can be found via another member's commit for the project: https://github.com/AnnabellemRuckle/MushroonMeadows.git

My source code and sprites can be found within my repository.

Developed a half-semester long game containing a 2-D platformer and a variation on “whack-a-mole”. 
Start: September 2023 
Finish: November 2023

Learned how to code in C# and use the Unity platform to single-handily create the mushroom version of “whack-a-mole”, the 3-D rendered houses in the main scene, and the sprites/images for both mini-games. My team and I collaborated and modularized the project. 

In each file, the contributor is properly cited.
